# Diamond-Sales-Prediction

This is a Data science project to predict Diamond price based on certain factors. Using the given data in diamonds.csv, we can predict price of new diamond with similar features.

Process I followed in the code is:
1. Installed the libraries that I used in the project (such as numpy and pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, joblib for saving the data.
2. Imported the libraries.
3. Studied the dataset and necessary cleaning.
4. Detected and removed outliers.
5. Preprocessing, splitting, standardising the data.
6. Trained Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Network model.
7. Compared both models with R squared error and Mean Squared error.
8. Plotted the data.
9. Saved the model
